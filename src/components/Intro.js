      <p>
        An aspiring fullstack developer with a passion for home automation and
        cybersecurity. While I primarily do frontend work, I'm starting to dip
        my toes into the work of backend development. When I'm not coiding, I
        can be found eating yummy foods, binge watching true crime
        documentaries, or playing with my kids.
